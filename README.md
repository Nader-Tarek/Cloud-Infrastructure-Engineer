1.  I took 4 hours to complete this task.

2.  the most difficult task for me was the second one not because of the CI/CD pipeline but because I never used EKS before so I was figuring out how to use it (most of my K8s experience were on GKE or local).

3.  mostly I will deep dive into EKS first before i build the CI/CD pipeline and I would construct a better Dockerfile becuase I got error while building Typescript so I didn't build it in mine So I would search more about the build process for Typescript applications.
